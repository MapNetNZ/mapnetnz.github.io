## Travel

Dunedin airport (DUD) is about 30 km out of town. Taxis from the airport cost $80+ and take half an hour or so. There are also shared shuttle services which can drop you in the centre of town or at your accommodation for about $18–25, and take around an hour. We recommend booking a seat in the shuttle in advance.
