# Code of conduct

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free meeting for everyone regardless of gender, gender expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion (or lack thereof).

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers are required to agree to this code of conduct. Organisers will enforce the code of conduct, and expect cooperation to ensure a safe environment for all.

We do not tolerate harassment of MapNet participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, social events, Twitter and other online media.

Participants engaging in harassing behaviour may be sanctioned in any way organisers deem appropriate. This includes:
- A warning to stop the behaviour followed by expulsion without refund if the behaviour continues
- Immediate expulsion from the conference without refund
- Forwarding of the harasser's details to partner institutions and events
 
In addition, if the harassing behaviour is part of a sponsor's display or a talk the display will be removed or the talk stopped without refund of the sponsorship.

**MapNet 2018 participants agree to**:

- Be considerate in speech and actions, and actively seek to acknowledge and respect the boundaries of fellow attendees.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behaviour and speech. Harassment includes, but is not limited to:
    + Stalking
    + Deliberate intimidation
    + Unwanted photography or recording
    + Discriminatory images in public spaces
    + Sustained or wilful disruption of talks or other events
    + Use of sexual or discriminatory imagery, comments, or jokes
    + Offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, religion
    + Inappropriate physical contact, which can include grabbing as well as hugging without asking or massaging without asking
    + Unwelcome sexual attention, which can include inappropriate questions of a sexual nature, asking for sexual favours or repeatedly asking for dates or contact information
- Alert a member of the code of conduct response team (listed below) if you notice a dangerous situation, someone in distress, or violations of this code of conduct, even if they seem inconsequential.

If you are asked to stop harassing behaviour, you must stop immediately, even if your behaviour was meant to be friendly or a joke. 

Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material.

## Requirements for talks

All slides and presentation materials are subject to the code of conduct. Materials should not have offensive or sexualised content. If this content is impossible to avoid given the topic, it should be noted both in the abstract and at the start of the talk.

## Need help?

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact one of the MapNet organisers (listed below).
