**[Click here to register](/register/)**.

## MapNet 2018

MapNet 2018 themes include epigenetics, indigenous health genomics, methodology advances and ecosystem and primary sector genomics. The [program](/program/) will be updated closer to the date.

## Workshop: from sequence to application

AgResearch is running and sponsoring a workshop on **genetic analysis using sequencing data** the day before MapNet, through the MBIE programme *Genomics for Production & Security in a Biological Economy*. The workshop is free. [Click here for more information](/program/#workshop).

### About MapNet 

MapNet is a group of New Zealand-based molecular and quantitative geneticists from organisations involved in research related to genomics. Organisations represented include Universities (Auckland, Canterbury, Massey, Otago, Unitec, Victoria), Crown Research Institutes (AgResearch, Environmental Science and Research, Landcare Research, NIWA, Plant & Food Research, Scion) and private entities (AbacusBio, The Elshire Group, Livestock Improvement Corporation). They encompass New Zealand's health, primary production, and conservation genetics sectors. MapNet aims to coordinate scientists from different organisations using common technologies and analytical platforms, to foster the development of multidisciplinary and cross-sector research projects, and to facilitate knowledge exchange between researchers.

We look forward to seeing you there.
