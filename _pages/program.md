# Program

We'll update this page with a detailed program closer to the meeting.

Sesson topics include:
- Methodology advances in statistical genetics
- Epigenetics 
- Primary sector empirical
- Ecosystem genomics
- Indigenous health, archaeological genetics (in conjunction with the annual Genomics Aotearoa symposium)

## GBS workshop

**Genetic analysis using sequencing data**

Monday, November 19, from 1pm

High-throughput sequencing is increasingly used for the development and implementation of genomic tools delivering outcomes for breeding, genetic diversity studies (*e.g.* inbreeding and co-ancestry) and population and conservation genetics. One of the bottlenecks using (low depth) sequencing data is appropriate data analysis tools. This workshop aims to present research using sequencing data and data analysis for different applications, including genetic diversity, breeding values, GWAS, linkage mapping, estimation of linkage disequilibrium, effective population size N<sub>e</sub>, etc.
