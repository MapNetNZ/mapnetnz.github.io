The conference dinner will be at a local restaurant on 20 November.

## Workshop

**From sequence to application**

Monday, November 19, from 1pm

High-throughput sequencing is increasingly used for the development and implementation of genomic tools delivering outcomes for breeding, genetic diversity studies (*e.g.* inbreeding and co-ancestry) and population and conservation genetics. One of the bottlenecks using (low depth) sequencing data is appropriate data analysis tools. This workshop aims to present research using sequencing data and data analysis for different applications, including genetic diversity, breeding values, GWAS, linkage mapping, estimation of linkage disequilibrium, effective population size N<sub>e</sub>, etc. The workshop is free. If you want to attend the workshop but not MapNet 2018, use the normal registration link and don't select a conference registration.
