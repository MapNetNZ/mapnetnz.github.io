## 3rd Molecular Mapping Workshop 2007

**Hamilton, New Zealand** 8th - 9th November 2007

### Conference aim and scope

This meeting focuses on genetic mapping in plants, animals and humans and will be a mix of oral presentations and workshops on the results and techniques from the NZ mapping community. There will be sessions on methods for genotyping, molecular mapping (LD and QTL mapping) and bioinformatics. After discussions at last years meeting, we hope to have a mix of formal talks and informal workshops. It will also be a chance to hear an update on MapNet from the steering committee.

### Keynote speaker

We are pleased to announce Dr Peter Langridge of the Australian Centre for Plant Functional Genomics has agreed to join us in Hamilton.
