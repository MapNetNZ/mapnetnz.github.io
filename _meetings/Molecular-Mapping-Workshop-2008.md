## 4th Molecular Mapping Workshop 2008

**Auckland, New Zealand** 8th December 2008

### Conference aim and scope

This meeting focuses on genetic mapping in plants, animals and humans and will be a mix of oral presentations on the results and techniques from the NZ mapping community. We hope to have updates from each MapNet organization, and some "hot topic" talks. It will also be a chance to hear an update on MapNet from the steering committee.

### Keynote speaker

We are pleased to announce Professor Bruce Weir of University of Washington has agreed to give the keynote address. He will speak on "Some lessons from recent million-SNP genome wide association studies".

### Conference venue

Science Centre Building 303, The University of Auckland, 38 Princes St, Auckland, New Zealand. See <http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/map>.

### Accommodation and transportation

Please see options listed on the Summer Institute of Statistical genetics website <http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/sisg2008>.

### Registration Cost

\$90 for full registration, and \$50 for student registration. This includes lunch, breaks and dinner. Link to Registration page: <https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/mapnet2008/register.php>

### Important dates and forms

Absracts due **Friday 17th of October**

Due to the shorter format for the workshop this year, we are encouraging each institution, or major group at each institution, to put in a joint abstract. Individual abstracts will also be considered. Plan on a 20 minute slot, with 15 minutes speaking and 5 minutes for questions.

Please write your abstract in a Word document if possible (if not, then use plain text). Use Times New Roman 12pt font. Your abstract should fit on an A4 page, and be limited to 250 words (including title, authors and affiliations).

E-mail your completed abstract to <mapnet2008@stat.auckland.ac.nz>

Registration due **Friday 31st of October**. Register online at <https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/mapnet2008/register.php>

### Programme

We will be running a one-day format, to fit in with the Summer Institute of Statistical Genetics (see below). We will start early on Monday morning, and finish the day with dinner at a nearby restaurant (the dinner plan is Turkish cuisine at <http://www.cafemidnightexpress.co.nz/>).

The full programme is now available: [Abstract book (pdf)](/assets/content/2008/NZMol_Mapping_workshop_2008_Programme-Abstracts_final.pdf). Copies of this document will be given to participants at the meeting, however you may wish to print information such as directions from this document prior to the meeting.

### Summer Institute of Statistical Genetics

Six modules (Population Genetic Data Analysis, Quantitative Genetics, Introduction to QTL Mapping, Association Mapping, Interpreting DNA Evidence, Computing for Statistical Genetics) will be taught during 9-16 December at the University of Auckland. The instructors include Bruce Weir and other leading international academics. See the website at <http://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/sisg2008>
