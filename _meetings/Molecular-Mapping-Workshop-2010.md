## 6th Molecular Mapping Workshop 2010

**Queenstown, New Zealand**
 2nd-3rd September 2010

## Conference aim and scope

This meeting focuses on genetic mapping in plants, animals and humans and will be a mix of oral presentations on the results and techniques from the NZ mapping community. We hope to have updates from each MapNet organization, and some "hot topic" talks. It will also be a chance to hear an update on MapNet from the steering committee.

## Keynote speaker

**Richard W. Michelmore** is the Director of the Genome Center at the University of California at Davis. He received BA and PhD degrees in Natural Sciences from the University of Cambridge, UK. He has been on the faculty at Davis since 1982. He is currently a Professor in the Departments of Plant Sciences, Molecular & Cellular Biology, and Medical Microbiology & Immunology. As the founding Director of the Genome Center since 2003, he has overseen the establishment of a research center with 16 new faculty and five genomics technology cores that serve the whole campus. More details can be found at <http://genomecenter.ucdavis.edu>. Dr. Michelmore has published over 125 scientific papers describing his research that focuses on comparative and functional plant genomics and biotechnology with an emphasis on disease resistance <http://michelmorelab.ucdavis.edu> . His interests span basic research into the molecular basis of specificity in plant-pathogen interactions to applied plant genetics. His multidisciplinary research utilizes a synthesis of molecular, genetic, and evolutionary approaches. In addition, his program coordinates and hosts the bioinformatics component of the Compositae Genome Project <http://compgenomics.ucdavis.edu/> . His teaching has covered the impacts of biotechnology and genomics on agriculture and society as a whole.
