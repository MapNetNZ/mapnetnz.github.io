**Instructor**: [Ken Dodds](mailto:ken.dodds@agresearch.co.nz), Statistician

**Cost**: \$130 + GST, Full-time students: \$100 +GST

This course will give an introduction to the concepts and issues around the analysis of genetic data involving genetic linkage. These methods are used to map and use genetic variants including those that influence traits of interest. As this is a short course, the emphasis will be on understanding genetic data and how linkage provides information. There will also be a short practical session on linkage analysis. Course content may be varied depending on registrants needs. Topics to be covered include the following:

-   Genetic Data
-   Experimental Designs
-   Segregation Analysis
-   Linkage analysis
-   QTL Analysis
-   Association (Linkage Disequilibrium)
-   Marker Assisted Selection

Registration includes Course Notes and Afternoon Tea
