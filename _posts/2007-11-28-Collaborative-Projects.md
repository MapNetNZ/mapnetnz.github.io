# VISG Bid

|Title:|Advanced Statistical Methods for Advanced Gene Mapping|
|Funding:|FRST - \$1,068,750 per year for 6 years|
|Section:|NERF (LNNR Portfolio)|
|Contractor:|New Zealand Forest Research Institute Ltd Trading as Scion|

### The Concept

This proposal was submitted to FRST in September 2007 as a concept document in the 2007 LNNR bidding round. This project proposes to establish a NZ-unique capability to deliver advanced statistical methods informed by common needs to end-user gene mappers working across the range of NZ sectors. If funded, it will coordinate and combine the efforts of leading NZ statisticians and geneticists, and train new statistical geneticists to ensure ongoing capability. Extensive international linkages via programme statisticians and advisors, combined with end-user involvement, will ensure international quality and relevance. To secure delivery and critical mass, lead statisticians (Drs Ball, Dodds, De Silva,and Browning) will be supplemented by PhD students and other statisticians. Students will be mentored by the senior scientists and will work alongside end-users in the specific project areas.

Specific areas defined by MapNet geneticists include: 1. Analytical methods for large data sets in anticipation of complete genome (re)sequence and/or multiple phenotypic data of various kinds (metabolites, proteins, etc), also integrated within appropriate bioinformatics tools. 2. Structural genetics: ascertaining impact of gene copy number and ploidy on trait variation; 3. Complex interactions among genes and integrated gene networks, utilising multiple data sources (mRNA, proteins and metabolites) integrated within bioinformatics platforms to generate and test hypotheses regarding molecular pathways and processes underpinning trait variation; 4. Population structure, both as a stand-alone topic, and integrated into association genetics. Analyses using existing tools (eg., STRUCTURE) have not allowed sensible interpretations of test populations ; 5. Bayesian methods for cross-species QTL mapping and association genetics. This will include development of methods to improve convergence properties of Monte Carlo Markov Chains. 6. Innovative experimental designs, incorporating gene interactions, spatial variation and optimal allocations of pedigrees and genotypes to maximise power to cost-efficiently detect common genes of small effect

# Association Genetics Bid

### Overview

This was discussed as a potential collaborative project for MapNet's plant geneticists. The basic idea (from Nnadozie Oraguzie) was to use an association genetics/candidate gene approach to determine if heritable phenotypic variation within a range of evolutionarily distant plant species was governed by the same or similar set of plant genes. Time constraints meant we were not able to progress this proposal in a sufficiently timely manner to have a proposal ready for the 2007 FRST bidding round. This topic area is of interest and MapNet will look to undertake such at work in the near future.

# KAREN Bid

### Overview

This proposal focuses on developing an online collaborative environment portal for MapNet, as well as evaluating high performance computing access and options for collaborative research (eg., VISG). Among the tools proposed are video conferencing and whiteboarding, so that we can converse with each other from remote locations without having to travel (and burn fossil fuels!) to a common locale to meet. More importantly it allows us new options and ways to collaborate - particularly for the VISG type concepts where we could have many people from different locales working on the same project.
