# 2nd New Zealand Molecular Mapping Workshop

**Palmerston North, New Zealand. 9th – 10th October 2006**

## Conference aim and scope

This meeting will be a forum for molecular mapping researchers within New Zealand to meet each other and discuss their methods, capabilities and advance in the field.

There will be sessions on methods for genotyping, molecular mapping (LD, QTL mapping etc…) and bioinformatics. The aim is to have a brief and concise presentation from each research group outlining their mapping studies (20 minute overview for each organisation). This will allow researchers to identify groups with common interests and share knowledge on particular methods, software or equipment. More technical sessions on genotyping and mapping and lectures will then follow with time for discussions at the end.

The meeting will also be the occasion for setting up a network between the researchers working on molecular mapping in New Zealand (MapNet).
